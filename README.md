# DevSecOps
A software development team requires code from multiple sources and work spaces. When a lot of developers are working on a project, their code must be well-integrated
in order to function as intended. Since changes are made frequently, these changes must first be validated and integrated to avoid potential coding errors. Continuous
Integration (CI) helps avoid these errors by allowing the development team to frequently implement, integrate, and check the code changes in a version control system. 
CI provides a constant mechanism to assimilate code changes from a variety of platforms, tools, and working spaces and maintain consistency. The integrated code should
then be delivered to different environments such as production, development, and testing. On the other hand, Continuous Delivery (CD) provides an automated approach to
push the code changes to these environments. A developerâ€™s changes to the software are automatically tested and uploaded to a repository which can then be deployed to a 
live production environment. The developer has to make minimal effort to deploy new code since every stage in CD involves testing and code release automation. The CI/CD
methodology allows the development team to constantly make code changes and automate the release of these codes, leading to better teamwork and fewer errors. 

 The complex process of CI/CD involves the use of a lot of different tools. The two major CI/CD ones are Jenkins and Tekton Pipelines. Jenkins is an automation server 
 that uses Jenkins Pipeline, a set of plugins that integrates continuous delivery practices into Jenkins. Likewise, the Tekton pipeline is a CI/CD framework for the
 Kubernetes platform that provides a cloud-native CI/CD experience. Besides these two, other CI/CD tools include Spinnaker, Screwdriver GoCD, and Concourse. Spinnaker 
 is a multi-cloud delivery platform that helps standardize the software release process with the use of a flexible pipeline management system. Likewise, screwdriver is 
 another open-source build platform designed for Continuous Delivery. GoCD is a CI/CD server that streamlines your workflow on cloud environments such as Kubernetes, 
 Docker, and more, with an emphasis on modeling and visualization while Concourse provides a general approach for CI/CD automation. These tools help a development team
 to make frequent changes to the code without the risk of an integration issue and automate the release of code to a central repository.
